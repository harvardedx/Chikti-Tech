Project description:
Agromap is a tool aimed at farmers, and companies that heavily depend and exploit water resources. 
Backed by Earth Observation technologies, including multiple satellites and up-to-date sensors, Agromap is a tool able to 
predict and display significant environmental threats like droughts and enhance the use of water for these users, making water-based 
industries a sustainable, well-optimized, way of life. Some of its features are; forecasting of environmental threats, optimization 
of water usage for crops, climate and body of water monitoring, and we even plan to offer courses to sustainably use water in order 
to comply with the ESG goals and certify your company in the correct use of water.
