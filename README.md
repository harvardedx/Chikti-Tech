**Theoretical Framework**

Agriculture is currently facing a series of critical challenges related to water management due to factors such as unpredictable weather conditions, pests, diseases, and climate change. These factors directly affect productivity, crop health, and global food security. The variability in water conditions can lead to extreme phenomena, such as prolonged droughts or sudden floods, which threaten farmers' profits and their ability to sustain production. This issue is particularly evident in regions with extreme or unpredictable climates, where both phenomena can occur in the same season, making agricultural planning even more difficult.

**Agricultural challenges related to water:**

Drought is a dry period or abnormally low precipitation, leading to water shortages. The lack of water affects crop growth, reduces yields, and can lead to total crop loss. Additionally, prolonged droughts also cause soil degradation and desertification.

In contrast, flooding is the occupation of water in areas that are normally dry. These excess water levels can cause soil erosion, loss of nutrients, and crop destruction. Typically, in areas where drainage infrastructure is insufficient, the consequences are devastating.

In relation to crop health, sudden climate changes can damage crops and reduce production. Consequently, regarding food security, climate variability affects food availability and can increase prices, which particularly impacts vulnerable communities.

Traditional approaches are often based on inherited agricultural practices and local experience. This can be effective but often does not account for climate variations and changes in precipitation patterns. Meanwhile, data-based approaches use technology such as sensors, climate models, and data analysis to optimize water management. These approaches allow for better planning and response to changing conditions, improving crop resilience.

**Earth Observation Data (EO):**
Earth Observation (EO) is defined as the collection of data on the Earth's surface, water bodies, and atmosphere through remote sensing (RS) platforms based on land, air, or satellites. Remote sensing can provide data at various spatial and temporal scales, adapting to different geographical contexts and observation periods. Its applications in agriculture are broad and include:
- Monitoring agricultural activities
- Predicting yields using models and forecasts
- Estimating seasonal production
- Determining the cultivation area
- Assessing the condition of crops

Remote sensing allows these tasks to be carried out remotely, efficiently, and at an accessible cost, overcoming the limitations of traditional methods, which often face logistical and accessibility obstacles. Additionally, remote sensing facilitates crop parameterization and characterizes their growth cycles.

The contributions of NASA's satellite missions, such as Landsat, MODIS, and SMAP, are fundamental in monitoring water resources. The Landsat satellite has been collecting data since the 1970s, providing an extensive satellite database that allows for detecting changes in the Earth's surface and its evolution over time.

MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) is a NASA satellite project that includes two platforms: MODIS Terra and MODIS Aqua. MODIS Terra crosses the equator from north to south in the morning, while MODIS Aqua does so from south to north in the afternoon. This mission collects data in various spectral bands, making it possible to understand global dynamics and processes occurring on the Earth's surface and in water bodies. The quality of the data collected allows for the provision of high-quality, personalized results for users.

The main water indicators in EO include soil moisture, evapotranspiration, and precipitation. Soil moisture refers to the water content in the soil and is crucial for plant growth and agricultural production. Accurate soil moisture measurement is essential for sustainable water resource management, agriculture, and drought prediction.

Some measurement methods are:
- **Remote sensing:** Different spectral bands on satellites are used to estimate soil moisture. Reflectance at certain wavelengths, such as near-infrared, can indicate the water content in the soil.
- **Hydrological models:** Remote sensing data is integrated with hydrological models to estimate soil moisture at different depths.

Applications include crop monitoring, irrigation management, and flood and drought prevention.

**Evapotranspiration** is the sum of water evaporation from the soil and transpiration from plants. This indicator is vital for understanding the water cycle and water use efficiency in agriculture. Its measurement methods include:
- **Remote sensing:** Satellites use algorithms that combine surface temperature data, soil moisture, and vegetation characteristics to estimate evapotranspiration.
- **Water Balance Methods:** Precipitation and runoff data are used along with soil moisture to calculate evapotranspiration.

This indicator supports agricultural planning, drought monitoring, and ecosystem health assessment.

**Precipitation** is the amount of water that falls on the Earth's surface in the form of rain, snow, or hail. It is a key indicator for assessing water availability in an area. Its measurement methods are:
- **Radar and Satellites:** Remote sensing platforms are used to measure precipitation continuously and on a large scale. Satellites like TRMM and GPM can provide accurate global precipitation estimates.
- **Weather Stations:** They complement remote sensing data by providing direct precipitation measurements at specific points.

Applications include weather forecasting, water resource assessment, and monitoring extreme weather events (floods, droughts).

In conclusion, Earth Observation (EO) and remote sensing are fundamental tools for sustainable water resource management and agricultural optimization. These technologies enable efficient monitoring of agricultural activities, yield prediction, and crop condition assessment through the analysis of high spatial and temporal resolution data.

NASA's satellite missions, such as Landsat and MODIS, provide valuable information on changes in the Earth's surface and climate dynamics. Key indicators, such as soil moisture, evapotranspiration, and precipitation, are essential for more precise planning and management, especially in regions vulnerable to extreme climatic events.

**Technological tools for agriculture:**

The integration of EO data into agricultural decision-making represents a significant advance in using technological tools to optimize agricultural practices. Through the collection of satellite information on variables like temperature, soil moisture, vegetation cover, and precipitation, farmers can improve crop efficiency, predict adverse weather conditions, and adopt preventive measures against natural disasters. This data-driven approach offers a solid foundation for agricultural planning and management, enabling more informed and precise decision-making.

**Existing platforms that connect EO with farmers** (e.g., IMERG for precipitation, OPERA for floods).

Various technological platforms connect Earth Observation (EO) data with farmers, allowing them to make better decisions based on accurate and real-time information. Among these platforms, IMERG provides detailed precipitation data, helping farmers plan irrigation and prepare for potential droughts or heavy rains. On the other hand, OPERA focuses on flood detection, offering early warnings that allow farmers to take preventive measures to protect their crops and properties. These tools are essential for integrating climate science into daily agricultural management.

**Challenges in creating accessible and farmer-friendly tools:**

One of the main challenges in creating technological tools for agriculture is ensuring they are accessible and user-friendly for farmers. Many lack access to advanced technologies or the necessary training to use complex platforms. Additionally, connectivity in rural areas may be limited, making efficient use of these tools more difficult. The design of intuitive interfaces and the provision of personalized technical support are key aspects to overcome these obstacles so that farmers can fully benefit from technological solutions without facing technical or usability barriers.

**Agricultural resilience to climate change:**

The role of Earth Observations (EO) in increasing farmers' resilience.

Earth Observations (EO) collect information about the chemical, physical, and meteorological state of the Earth, which farmers can use to understand the trends of rain cycles, temperature, and soil quality for their crops. These tools essentially allow farmers to know the path to take to optimize their management of natural resources, such as water.

With the information collected by EO, action plans can be created for the preservation of crops and natural resources during natural disasters such as droughts, floods, or fires, which in turn optimizes the management of these resources during non-disaster seasons. Additionally, farmers can observe climate change trends and determine the best periods for planting certain crops.

**Examples of how satellite data helps manage water resource risks in extreme climate scenarios:**

The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) measures variations in the Earth's gravitational field and, consequently, changes in groundwater storage, such as in aquifers and springs. With this information, a farmer can know in advance when droughts will occur and plan according to their resources.

**Scalability and accessibility of technological solutions for farmers of different sizes and locations:**

The information from the GRACE satellite is available to the public with a browser and a stable internet connection, making remote access to this information essential when discussing farmers in remote or hard-to-reach areas.

**Innovations in water resource management:**

Currently, managing the planet's water resources is crucial for handling food, crops, and entire societies. Therefore, multiple systems and tools have been implemented over the years, such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS), various Climate Models, Water Footprint Assessment Technologies, Desalination and Water Reuse Technologies, as well as Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM).

However, there is a noted lack of integration and easy, direct, and free access to vital information provided by these tools, often leading to resource misuse, droughts, and, above all, a high-impact global crisis of utmost importance. Thus, SunDrops innovates in the field of data collection and management for water resource management by:

- Combining emerging technologies like drones and IoT sensors with satellite data.
- Comparing satellite and field observations for personalized recommendations.
- Impacting digital agriculture by optimizing water use and reducing climate risks.
- Presenting and translating data in a simple and useful way.
- Providing access to innovative tools.
- Diagnosing needs and optimizing water resources based on surrounding areas.
- Providing tools for calculating water use based on seed type, planting, and size.
- Conducting geographic, climatic, and sedimentary analysis of areas for optimization.
- Issuing risk pattern warnings to prevent upcoming natural events.
- Rating water use efficiency and sustainability.
- Creating certificates for sustainable water use compliance.

In this way, climate change and the growing demand for food require innovative solutions to ensure global food security. Farmers, as key players in this chain, must have access

 to tools that allow them to efficiently manage water resources and reduce losses associated with extreme climate events.

Therefore, the use of spatial data provided by NASA, combined with easy-to-access and user-friendly tools, will allow farmers to better adapt to changing conditions, reduce their vulnerability, and increase their responsiveness. In summary, this challenge aims to provide technological solutions that improve agricultural performance and long-term sustainability. The design of a tool that integrates NASA data to facilitate agricultural decision-making is an essential step toward the modernization and sustainability of global agriculture. Through the use of Earth Observation technology, farmers can gain deeper insights into water use and soil conditions, enabling them to optimize resources and increase productivity, thus facing the challenges of climate change and the growing demand for food.
